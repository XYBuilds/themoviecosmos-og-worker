# Domain Docs

How the engineering skills should consume this repo's domain documentation when exploring the codebase.

## Before exploring, read these

- **`CONTEXT.md`** at the repo root.
- **`docs/adr/`** — read ADRs that touch the area you're about to work in.

If either location doesn't exist, **proceed silently**. Don't flag its absence or suggest creating it upfront. The `/domain-modeling` skill creates domain context lazily when terms or decisions are actually resolved.

## File structure

This is a single-context repository:

```
/
├── CONTEXT.md
├── docs/adr/
│   └── 0001-wrangler-managed-zone-routes.md
└── src/
```

## Use the glossary's vocabulary

When your output names a domain concept—in an issue title, refactor proposal, hypothesis, or test name—use the term defined in `CONTEXT.md`. Don't drift to synonyms the glossary explicitly avoids.

If the concept isn't in the glossary, reconsider whether you're inventing language the project doesn't use. If the gap is real, record it through `/domain-modeling`.

## Flag ADR conflicts

If your output contradicts an existing ADR, surface it explicitly rather than silently overriding:
