# Issue tracker: GitLab

Issues and specifications for the OG Worker live in the private GitLab project. Use the `glab` CLI for Issue and merge-request operations. Provider Issue numbers and URLs are aliases; portable identities use `tmc:og-worker:<ULID>`.

## New work

- Bug reports and feature requests enter through GitLab Issues.
- Maintainer triage decides whether an Issue is a duplicate, needs more information, is accepted, or needs design work.
- A Spec Issue receives `ready-for-agent` only when its acceptance criteria and implementation seams are sufficiently clear.

## Cross-repository Initiatives

- Product-level Initiatives live in Chronicle unless the work is primarily Daily-domain work.
- This repository receives a child implementation Issue for Worker-owned delivery.
- Child Issues link back to the parent with a titled portable parent reference and name local tests and delivery constraints. The current Recovery Initiative parent is Restore development and operations without a GitHub account single point of failure (`tmc:chronicle:01M08QA80S7XA8P5ZVKM3EVD8Q`).
- Use portable identities plus titled references when linking across repositories.

## Merge requests

Merge requests are implementation and review surfaces, not substitutes for accepted product specifications. The repository does not currently treat external merge requests as an untriaged feature-request queue. Human merge approval is mandatory; do not bypass protected `main`.

## Current labels

The repository keeps ordinary labels such as `bug`, `enhancement`, `documentation`, `duplicate`, `good first issue`, `help wanted`, `invalid`, and `question`. Matt workflows use the canonical `needs-triage`, `needs-info`, `ready-for-agent`, `ready-for-human`, and `wontfix` labels defined in `docs/agents/triage-labels.md`.

Wayfinder maps use `wayfinder:map`. Their child tickets use exactly one of `wayfinder:research`, `wayfinder:prototype`, `wayfinder:grilling`, or `wayfinder:task`.

## Wayfinding operations

Wayfinder uses ordinary GitLab Issues plus portable identities. GitLab Free records parent and blocker meaning in the Issue body; a native relationship may mirror those lines where available. Do not maintain a second writable tracker.

- **Map:** create one Issue labelled `wayfinder:map`. Its body contains Destination, Notes, Decisions so far, Not yet specified, and Out of scope.
- **Child ticket:** create an Issue with exactly one `wayfinder:<type>` label. The body includes `Part of: <map title> (\`<map portable id>\`)`.
- **Blocking:** keep a `Blocked by: <title> (\`<portable id>\`)` line in the Issue body. GitLab Free does not treat native relationships as the only readable truth.
- **Frontier:** list the map's open child Issues in map order, then exclude any Issue with an assignee or a `Blocked by` line whose blockers are still open.
- **Claim:** assign the ticket before any work with `glab issue update <iid> --assignee @me`.
- **Resolve:** post the answer as a resolution comment, close the ticket, and append one linked gist of the answer to the map's Decisions so far section.

If the active tracker becomes unavailable, promote the newest verified normalized export as the sole writable local Markdown tracker and record the failover time. Never reconcile by writing two trackers at once.

## Tracker transition

A tracker transition freezes the predecessor, exports and verifies a normalized Markdown bundle, imports and verifies the destination, and only then promotes the destination. Local Markdown, GitHub, and GitLab are never writable at the same time. Suspended GitHub Issues remain alias candidates for capture-first reconciliation if access returns.
